This model is from the iQue Super Mario 64 version that is on chinese.
I included the original rip of the model, in which, I only changed texture paths, it's in the "Original" folder.
The "Blue", "Green", "Red", "Yellow" are textures from the normal logo.
I put these textures in, so the model would have color.
If it doesn't, then just apply the textures yourself, it's not hard.
If you use the model, you don't need to give credit, but if you want you can do so.
